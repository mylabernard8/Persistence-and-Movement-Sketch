# Reflection:

### What was challenging for you during this process?
Learning about conditionals has been hard because at first, it was challenging to keep track of all the different ways conditions could be set up, especially understanding when and why to use if, else if, and else. Sometimes I found myself lost in the logic, trying to get the program to respond the way I wanted. Debugging my code was tough at times because a small mistake, like a missing or extra bracket, could completely change the outcome.

### What makes more sense now than it did before you started?
However, as I practiced, I started seeing how powerful conditionals are in controlling the flow of a program. Now, I feel more confident setting up multiple conditions to check different cases, and it makes more sense how each conditional connects to create a sequence of actions based on specific situations.

### What are you proud of?
I'm proud of the times I stuck with a tricky problem until I figured it out. Each time my code ran correctly because of the conditions I set up, it felt like a win! It’s rewarding to see the program respond correctly, knowing that it’s all because of the careful logic I crafted.
