# Reflection:
### What was challenging for you during this process?
The most challenging part for me during this project was trying to make sure the syntax in my code was correct, which took a lot of trial and error for me, but I enventually found my mistake. This was actually very helpful thpugh because when I ran into the problem later on, I knew exactly how to fix it. Another challenging aspect of this was doing outide research to help create the shape I wanted.
### What makes more sense now than it did before you started?
Something that makes more sense to me now than it did before was how to use multiple varibles to help make code more concised and easy to read. Another thing that I learned how to do was add in different aspects, like time and color to be a changing factor in my code.
### What are you proud of?
I am really proud of the code I was able complete and all of the challenges I was able to overcome and learn from, no matter how annoying it felt in the moment.
